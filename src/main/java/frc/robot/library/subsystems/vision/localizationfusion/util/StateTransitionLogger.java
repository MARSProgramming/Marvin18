/**
 * Interface for logging state transitions in the localization system.
 *
 * <p>This interface provides a standardized way to record and monitor state machine transitions
 * within the localization system. It enables:
 *
 * <p>- Real-time monitoring of system behavior - Post-match analysis of state changes - Debugging
 * of unexpected transitions - Performance tracking and optimization - System health monitoring
 *
 * <p>Implementations should consider: - Logging to NetworkTables for real-time monitoring -
 * Persistent storage for post-match analysis - Timestamp recording for timing analysis - Context
 * preservation for debugging - Rate limiting for high-frequency transitions

   * Records a state transition in the localization system.
   *
   * <p>This method is called whenever the system transitions between states. Implementations
   * should: - Record the timestamp of the transition - Log both the previous and new states -
   * Include relevant context if available - Handle rapid transitions appropriately - Ensure thread
   * safety
   *
   * <p>Common transitions to monitor: - UNINITIALIZED → RESETTING (Initial pose acquisition) -
   * RESETTING → QUEST_PRIMARY (Successful initialization) - QUEST_PRIMARY → TAG_BACKUP (Quest
   * failure or validation error) - TAG_BACKUP → QUEST_PRIMARY (Quest recovery) - Any → EMERGENCY
   * (System failure)
